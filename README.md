# Car Price Prediction
A Flask-based web application that predicts the market price range of used cars based on user-provided features such as car brand, model year, fuel type, transmission, mileage, and other relevant parameters.

The goal of this project is to help users estimate a fair buying or selling price for old cars using machine learning.
